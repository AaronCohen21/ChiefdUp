# Chief'd Up!
 I am going to create a game similar to Jackbox’s Champ’d Up. The multiplayer game will run from a server on one player’s phone, utilizing the java.net library. Multiple games may be run on the same network, and players will connect to different games with a game pin, that being the port number of the server. The server code will be directly integrated into the application, and run from a host client on a different Thread automatically when creating a new game. The game works as such: each player receives a unique prompt to draw “the CEO of ________”. The players will have a set amount of time to draw their CEO, and give it a name. After the CEO’s have been drawn, each player will receive another player’s drawing, and will be required to draw a new CEO to rival against it. However, when drawing the rival CEO, the player will not have the prompt, they will only have the CEO and its name; this makes the player have to guess what the prompt is as best as they can. After all CEOs and rivals have been drawn, players will vote on which ones are the best, and get points if their drawings win. This game will be uniquely called “Chief’d Up!”
